# WASDBox
Based on the Flatbox Rev 5 by jfedor2 which can be located at https://github.com/jfedor2/flatbox/tree/master/hardware-rev5

IMPORTANT THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND: This has not been printed yet, I will do so at a later date when i have everything required to do so. This also only contains the necessary files to get the PCB and the case made, as well as the original files that can be edited to your hearts content, although I would recommend starting off with the Rev 5 instead
