# WASDBox
Based on the Flatbox Rev 5 by jfedor2 which can be located at https://github.com/jfedor2/flatbox/tree/master/hardware-rev5
Will probably make a new version at some point that keeps the lower button from the original Flatbox with the new layout, moving one of the 8 rightmost buttons over, it wont replace this, but will be an option to those who want it

IMPORTANT THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND: This has not been printed yet, I will do so at a later date when i have everything required to do so. This also only contains the necessary files to get the PCB and the case made, as well as the original files that can be edited to your hearts content, although I would recommend starting off with the Rev 5 instead
